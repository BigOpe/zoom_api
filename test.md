Okay, I will try to explain it again in more detail. Here are the steps to get an API key and access token for use in Zoom's API:

- First, you need to create a Zoom account if you don't have one already. You can sign up for free at https://zoom.us/signup.
- Next, you need to log in to the Zoom Developer Portal at https://marketplace.zoom.us/. This is where you can create and manage your apps that use Zoom's API.
- To create an app, click on Develop > Build App on the top right corner of the portal. You will see a page where you can choose the app type. For this example, we will use OAuth as the app type, which means that your app will ask users to authorize it to access their Zoom account information.
- Enter the basic information for your app, such as name, description, and logo. You can also choose whether your app is intended for internal use only (within your own Zoom account) or external use (for other Zoom users). Click Create when you are done.
- You will be taken to the App Dashboard, where you can see and edit various settings for your app. On the App Credentials tab, you will see your Client ID and Client Secret, which are your API key and secret. You will need these values later to request an access token. You will also need to enter a Redirect URL, which is where Zoom will send the user after they authorize your app. This URL must match with the one you specify in your code when you redirect the user to Zoom's authorization page. For example, you can use https://example.com/callback as your Redirect URL.
- On the Scopes tab, you will need to select the permissions that your app needs to access Zoom resources. The scopes you choose will determine what API endpoints you can call and what webhook events you can subscribe to. For example, if you want your app to list the user's meetings, you will need the meeting:read scope. You can see the list of available scopes and their descriptions at https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/guides/auth/oauth#scopes.
- On the Activation tab, you can activate your app and generate a Publishable URL, which is a link that you can share with users to install your app. When a user clicks on this link, they will be taken to Zoom's authorization page, where they can see what scopes your app is requesting and choose to Authorize or Decline. If they authorize your app, they will be redirected to your Redirect URL with a code parameter in the query string. This code is called an Authorization Code, and you will need it to request an access token.
- To request an access token, you need to make a POST request to https://zoom.us/oauth/token with the following parameters: grant_type=authorization_code, code=your_authorization_code, redirect_uri=your_redirect_url. You also need to pass your Client ID and Client Secret as Basic Auth credentials in the request header. For example, in Python, you can use the requests library to make this request:

```python
import requests
import base64

client_id = "your_client_id"
client_secret = "your_client_secret"
auth_code = "your_authorization_code"
redirect_uri = "your_redirect_url"

# Encode client credentials as Basic Auth
credentials = base64.b64encode(f"{client_id}:{client_secret}".encode()).decode()

# Set request headers
headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Basic {credentials}"
}

# Set request parameters
params = {
    "grant_type": "authorization_code",
    "code": auth_code,
    "redirect_uri": redirect_uri
}

# Make POST request
response = requests.post("https://zoom.us/oauth/token", headers=headers, params=params)

# Parse response JSON
data = response.json()

# Get access token and refresh token
access_token = data["access_token"]
refresh_token = data["refresh_token"]
```

- If the request is successful, you will receive a JSON response with an access token and a refresh token. The access token is a string that represents the authorization granted to your app by the user. The refresh token is a string that allows you to request a new access token when the current one expires. You should store these tokens securely and use them for subsequent API requests.
- To make an API request with an access token, you need to pass it as a Bearer token in the Authorization header of the request. For example, if you want to list the user's meetings using the /users/me/meetings endpoint, you can use this Python code:

```python
import requests

access_token = "your_access_token"

# Set request headers
headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {access_token}"
}

# Make GET request
response = requests.get("https://api.zoom.us/v2/users/me/meetings", headers=headers)

# Parse response JSON
data = response.json()

# Print meeting details
for meeting in data["meetings"]:
    print(f"Meeting ID: {meeting['id']}")
    print(f"Meeting Topic: {meeting['topic']}")
    print(f"Meeting Status: {meeting['status']}")
    print()
```

- If the request is successful, you will receive a JSON response with the meeting details. You can see the documentation for each API endpoint at https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/api-reference/zoom-api.
- Access tokens are valid for one hour from the time they are issued. When an access token expires, you will receive an error response with the code 124 and the message "Invalid access token." To request a new access token, you need to make a POST request to https://zoom.us/oauth/token with the following parameters: grant_type=refresh_token, refresh_token=your_refresh_token. You also need to pass your Client ID and Client Secret as Basic Auth credentials in the request header. For example, in Python, you can use this code:

```python
import requests
import base64

client_id = "your_client_id"
client_secret = "your_client_secret"
refresh_token = "your_refresh_token"

# Encode client credentials as Basic Auth
credentials = base64.b64encode(f"{client_id}:{client_secret}".encode()).decode()

# Set request headers
headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Basic {credentials}"
}

# Set request parameters
params = {
    "grant_type": "refresh_token",
    "refresh_token": refresh_token
}

# Make POST request
response = requests.post("https://zoom.us/oauth/token", headers=headers, params=params)

# Parse response JSON
data = response.json()

# Get new access token and refresh token
access_token = data["access_token"]
refresh_token = data["refresh_token"]
```

- If the request is successful, you will receive a JSON response with a new access token and a new refresh token. You should replace the old tokens with the new ones and use them for subsequent API requests.

I hope this helps you understand how to get an API key and access token for use in Zoom's API. If you have any questions or need more clarification, please let me know.




If you are using the zoom-us python module¹, you can simplify the process of getting an API key and access token for use in Zoom's API. The zoom-us module is a wrapper around the Zoom API that handles the authentication and request details for you. You can install it using pip:

```
pip install zoomus
```

To use the zoom-us module, you need to create a ZoomClient object with your API key and secret. You can get these values from the App Credentials tab of your OAuth app on Zoom's developer portal². For example:

```python
from zoomus import ZoomClient

client = ZoomClient('API_KEY', 'API_SECRET')
```

The ZoomClient object has various methods that correspond to the Zoom API endpoints. For example, to list the user's meetings, you can use:

```python
user_list_response = client.user.list()
user_list = user_list_response.json()

for user in user_list['users']:
    user_id = user['id']
    print(client.meeting.list(user_id=user_id).json())
```

The zoom-us module will automatically request an access token and refresh it when it expires. You don't need to worry about passing it in the request header or handling errors. You can see the documentation for the zoom-us module at https://github.com/prschmid/zoomus.
